This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java that leads to an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The `BuggyLoop.java` file contains the faulty code, while `CorrectedLoop.java` provides the corrected version. The error arises from an incorrect loop condition which attempts to access an index that is out of bounds. The solution involves adjusting the loop condition to iterate up to, but not including, the array's length.
